### What is Threading
Threading is a programming concept that allows multiple threads to be executed concurrently within a single process. 
This enables a program to perform multiple operations simultaneously, which can improve performance, responsiveness, and resource utilization.

### About This Repo
In this repository, I provide an example of constructing a threaded architecture to reduce processing time. 
The code is intentionally kept simple and serves as a straightforward demonstration of threading concepts, 
aimed at explaining how threading can be implemented effectively.

### Toy Example
To help illustrate the concept, we will focus on a toy example. 
Imagine you want to implement a visual tracker using YOLO. YOLO detects objects in an image frame, 
and then a tracker processes the labels and bounding boxes to track individual objects within the scene..
